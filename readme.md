BATTLE ARENA BOT Fork - Zombie Madness Mod
--------------

## ABOUT

Zombie Madness Mod is a text game based on the popular Battle Arena Bot. This mod is under construction and in it's early stages but will be created for the entertainment of a Newsgroup Network in Canada which will allow localized game play. Where Battle Arena Bot is designed to work in one channel one monster at a time I hope with time it can be altered to allow mutiple monsters in mutiple channels, each channel will be for each city within this province. There is much work to be done though.

## SETUP

Getting it set up is easy assuming you unpack the zip in a good location on your computer.

 1. Do a CLEAN install to C:\BattleArena\  with the complete zip package of the bot (either from this repository or from my website).
 2. Patch the bot to the latest versions if there are any patches. Don't skip versions unless I specifically say it's all right.  ALSO NOTE: DO NOT HAVE THE BOT RUNNING WHEN YOU APPLY PATCHES!
 3. Run the mirc.exe included with Complete Package.
 4. The bot will attempt to help you get things set up.  Set the bot owner's nick and the IRC channel you wish to game in.  Be sure to set a password for the bot that you'll register to nickserv with.
 5. (as with all mIRC programs) change the nickname and add a server
 6. Connect.
 7. Using another IRC connection as the bot owner's nick, use !new char (nick) without the () to get the character creation process started.
 8. Follow what the bot tells you to do.  Be sure to check out player_guide.txt as well.

Note, you do NOT have to install it to C:\BattleArena\ However, it's recommended.
