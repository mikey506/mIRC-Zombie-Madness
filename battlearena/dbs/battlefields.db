==============================================================
The weather is now controlled via this file rather than
weather.lst.  It works the same though.  Boost= how much 
the correct weather will boost a magic spell.

Do not remove the [weather] section or the bot will have 
problems.
==============================================================

[weather]
current=Calm
list=calm.bright.gloomy.rainy.stormy.snowy.windy.hot.dry
boost=.25


==============================================================
The moon phases are controlled in this file as well.  Please
do not remove or modify the Moon Phase section as it will cause
errors.
==============================================================

gibbous=5

==============================================================
The "Time of Day" is controlled in this file. Please do not
remove or modify the time of day section as it will cause
errors.
==============================================================

==============================================================
Battlefields are where the players face the monsters.
The battlefields themselves control the weather and
may have events that occasionally happen. There
can be more than one event set per battlefield. 

Please look at the pre-existing events for 
how to set it all up.

Valid Targets: all, random, monsters, players
 * note that "players" as a target also affects NPCs

Valid Event Types: damage, heal, statusonly

Valid Limitations: no-tech, no-item, no-skill, no-ignition
                   enhance-item, enhance-melee, enhance-tech
                   no-mech, no-trusts, no-summons
 * note that no-trusts also means no npcs in portal battles

** If you make a new battlefield and want the bot to be able
to select it for battles, make sure you put the name of it
into battlefields.lst
